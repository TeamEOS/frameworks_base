    <!-- The factor to increase gesture touch slop. It seems the default values
         from ViewConfiguration are too small for Fling. Often taps and long presses
         are canceled when they shouldn't be. Applies only to Fling gesture detector

         touchSlop = ViewConfiguration.getTouchSlop() * ((100 + increase_factor) / 100))

         Default value is a 35% increase in allowed "sloppiness".
         Adjust in overlay for device specific precision -->
